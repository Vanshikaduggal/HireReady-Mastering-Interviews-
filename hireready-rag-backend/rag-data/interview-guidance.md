**Example:**
*"Tell me about a time you faced a difficult bug"*

**S:** During my internship, our React app had a memory leak causing crashes.
**T:** I was responsible for fixing it as it affected production.
**A:** I used React DevTools Profiler, identified unnecessary re-renders, implemented useMemo and useCallback hooks.
**R:** Reduced memory usage by 40%, eliminated crashes, and improved app performance.
