## Tips for Faster Learning

### Study Techniques
1. **Active Learning** - Build projects, don't just watch tutorials
2. **Spaced Repetition** - Review concepts every 3-7 days
3. **Feynman Technique** - Teach concepts to someone else
4. **Project-Based Learning** - Learn by building real applications
5. **Debugging Practice** - Don't just copy code, understand it

### Time Management
- **2-3 hours daily** is better than 10 hours on weekends
- **Morning sessions** for DSA (when mind is fresh)
- **Evening sessions** for projects and learning
- **Take breaks** - Pomodoro technique (25 min work, 5 min break)

### Avoid Common Mistakes
❌ Tutorial hell (watching without building)
❌ Learning too many technologies at once
❌ Perfectionism (build first, refine later)
❌ Comparing yourself to others
❌ Not asking for help when stuck
❌ Ignoring fundamentals

✅ Build projects regularly
✅ Focus on one stack at a time
✅ Ship imperfect projects
✅ Track your own progress
